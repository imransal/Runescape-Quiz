## Introduction

Welcome to The Runescape Quiz, my second milestone project. 

The goal of the Runescape Quiz is to expand my knowledge and build on the fundamentals I learned from my first milestone project, GymBox which used HTML & CSS. This project will hopefully be able to display some of my fundamental understanding in Javascript.

Runescape was one of my childhood favorite games, this is where a large part of the inspiration comes from. Runescape is such a vast game and still has a popular fan base after 22 years of it running.

I document the steps I took to plan and create this website as well as where I got my inspiration from and sources of information.

## UX - User Experience Design

To help with design, I took inspiration from the Runescape website and theme. 

The planning of the project is broken into 5 planes,

 - [The Strategy Plane](https://github.com/imransal/Runescape-Quiz/blob/main/README.md#strategy-plane)
 - [The Scope Plane](https://github.com/imransal/Runescape-Quiz/blob/main/README.md#scope-plane)
 - [The Structure Plane](https://github.com/imransal/Runescape-Quiz/blob/main/README.md#structure-plane)
 - [The Skeleton Plane](https://github.com/imransal/Runescape-Quiz/blob/main/README.md#skeleton-plane)
 - [The Surface Plane](https://github.com/imransal/Runescape-Quiz/blob/main/README.md#surface-plane)
 

## Strategy Plane

The objective of this project is to deliver a visually appealing and easy to use Quiz App to the end users, that is fun & interactive with the ability to track their high scores and a leaderboard.

### Creator Goals

 - I want the Quiz App to have a similar color scheme and typography, and to do so I have chosen the font-family: 'Rakkas' using google fonts.
 - I want the Quiz App to be responsive accross different resolutions for all devices.

After establishing the user experience strategy, the next vital step is to adopt a user-centric approach and speak to myfriends who have played Runescape to gain their perspective. This approach will enable me to guarantee that their interaction with the game is pleasant and satisfying.


### User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

 - As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to navigate my way easily throughout the website.
 - As a first-time visitor, I want to learn things I didn't know about Runescape.
 - As a first-time visitor, I want to see some instructions on how to play and how to see the leaderboard.
 - As a first-time visitor, I want to see something that reminds me of Runescape, and an attractive design.
 - As a first-time visitor, I want to be know if I was right or wrong when I selected my answer to a question on the App.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

 - As a returning visitor, I want my scores to be saved and track my score on a leaderboard.
 

#### Types of expected visitor goals

- Fans of the game, Runescape.

- Someone who may be interested in playing Runescape.

I decided to create a Runescape quiz application due to my personal experience with the game and time as a player. I have a genuine passion for this game, which has given me valuable insight into what users might be seeking when using my quiz application. These insights have been essential in shaping my User Stories.

My quiz application is designed to provide an enjoyable and straightforward experience for users while offering them valuable information about the game. I aim to present the questions in a clear and concise manner, without overwhelming the users with too much information at once.

Since a significant portion of the target audience is likely to access the quiz application using their mobile devices, it is crucial to create a responsive design. This will ensure that the quiz runs smoothly on all devices, providing a seamless experience for all users.

## Scope Plane

To achieve the desired user and business goals for my Runescape quiz app, the following features will be included:

- Simple homepage will be designed with a clean and straightforward layout that includes a navigation menu at the top with a Start Game and a Leaderboard button.
- Quiz page with include a navigation bar, a start game button, a question count and score tally and quiz questions and answer buttons with a quit game button.
- End of quiz page will have a form to submit high scores and control buttons.
- Instructions page will have a navigation bar and instructions on how to play the quiz.
- Leaderboard page will have a navigation bar and a list of the top 5 high scores.
 
## Structure Plane

For the Runescape quiz app, the design will focus on a theme that is relatable to the Runescape game. The color scheme will feature the classic yellow and black of the Runescape logo, with white used as a contrasting color. The font selection will include a modern and easy-to-read font, along with the bold and fun fonts for H1 headers.

To keep the quiz easy to navigate for users, the website will be divided into multiple pages, including a rules page, a game page, and a high scores page. Each page will feature a responsive navbar, with the relevant content centered below. The quiz itself will have a responsive layout with a question, and four answer buttons to makie it straight forward for the user. The final quiz page will have navigation buttons to let the user know how to move on from the page.

## Skeleton Plane

Here is a link to the Wireframes I designed.

- [Homepage](https://ibb.co/Jyk3WKb)
- [Quiz Page](https://ibb.co/QfCd3w7)
- [Instructions Page](https://ibb.co/M690QrS)
- [Leaderboard](https://ibb.co/hYtRsnb)

### Homepage Differences 

The Homepage wireframe design was met, the only difference here is that instead of using a gameplay screenshot, a game art was used.

### Quiz Page Differences

The Quiz Page wireframe design was met, the only difference is that the question does not have a border and instead a h2 header in its own div.

### Instructions Page Differences

### Leaderboard Page Differences

The Leaderboard Page wireframe design was met, the only differences is that there is no border around the leaderboard and I added buttons to start the quiz or return to the homepage.

## Surface Plane 

**Project Features**

The Runescape Javascript quiz project includes a responsive navigation bar, a dark theme with a hero image, and feedback colors for selected answers. Users can save their high score with a name, which is stored in local storage and can be viewed on the High Score page. The score updates with every answer selected, with correct answers awarding 100 points and a maximum of 1000 available at the end. The navigation bar is present across all pages except for the Quiz page and changes to a burger bar menu at 992px.

### Features to upgrade this project in the future

For future features, I want to consider adding a hint system to assist users in answering questions. I want to consider implementing social media sharing options to allow users to share their scores with friends and on different platforms and also a timer for each question.

## Testing

In this section, I will test the user stories from the User Experience Design section in this README.md.

### User Story Testing

#### 1. As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to navigate my way easily throughout the website.

![User Story 1 Screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/9HQ230k/user-story-1.jpg)

As soon as you enter the home page of the Quiz App you are presented with a hero image that lets you know what the Quiz is about and two buttons making it very simple for the user to understand and navigate.

#### 2. As a first-time visitor, I want to learn things I didn't know about Runescape.

When the user starts the Quiz they are presented with a series of 10 Questions, some of which are entry level if you have played the Runescape game before and some Questions are very particular and difficult, so there is no doubt all types of users will have learnt something by the time they have finished the Quiz.

#### 3. As a first-time visitor, I want to see some instructions on how to play and how to see the leaderboard.

There is an Instructions page I have built for this purpose. The Instructions page gives the user step by step instructions on how to play and what the functions of the App do including the Leaderboard. 

#### 4. As a first-time visitor, I want to see something that reminds me of Runescape, and an attractive design.

When the user lands on the homepage they are faced with a beautiful runescape art work along with the black and yellow Runescape theme. I chose the "Rakkas" font as I feel it is a good suit for the Runescape font the game uses.

#### 5. As a first-time visitor, I want to be know if I was right or wrong when I selected my answer to a question on the App.

The Runescape Quiz will let you know when you have a got a question right and when you have a got a question wrong. The correct answer will turn green upon selection, whereas the incorrect answer will turn red upon selection.



### Known Bugs and Fixes


## W3C Validation

## Deployment

### How to deploy a GitHub Repository using GitHub Pages

1. Go to your Repository section in GitHub and select the Repository you want to deploy.
2. Click on the Settings link on the top horizontal Menu.
3. Now on the settings page, find the Pages link, about halfway down, on the menu on the left-hand side.
4. Under Branch, select the dropdown that says None, select Main, and then click save. 
5. Wait for the page to refresh. Once the page has refreshed you can scroll back up and on the GitHub Pages Section you should see a message that says Your site is live at (Link to Live GitHub Pages Website) The live site does not usually publish straight away and sometimes takes a few minutes to become live.

### How to Fork the GitHub Repository

Forking a GitHub repository allows you to make a copy of the original repository that you can make changes to without affecting the original repository.

1. Go to the GitHub repository you wish to make a Fork of.
2. At the top of the page, opposite the repository name there is a button that says Fork.
3. Now you have a copy of the repository in your GitHub account. You can find it in your repositories section.

### How to make a Local Clone of  your GitHub Repository

1. Go to the GitHub repository you wish to make a Local Clone of.
2. Click on the Code button.
3. Copy the link that is displayed on the drop-down.
4. Open GitPod and choose the directory where you would like the clone to be created
5. Now go to the Terminal in GitPod and type in 'git clone'.
6. Press Enter and your cloned repository will be created.
